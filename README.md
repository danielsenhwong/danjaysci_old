Jay Lab Website

The purpose of this project is to increase the efficiency of the lab. This 
will be accomplished by centralizing inventories of lab reagents, including
but not limited to: chemicals, plasmids, primers/oligs, and biological samples
stored in liquid nitrogen. Additionally, to foster the growth of CALI-related
and -based research, a list of relevant publications in the field will be 
maintained here.
